## Fitmap

Fitmap is an application that allows users to add markers to their current location map in order to track their workouts across the region. The project is focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts without adhering to any specific architecture. Please note that this is a work in progress and it was clearly inspired by Jonas Schmetdmann's 'Mapty', but designed for portuguese-speaking users.

## Project Overview

Fitmap aims to provide a simple and intuitive interface for fitness enthusiasts to log and track their workouts by marking their locations on a map. Users can view their workout history and visualize their fitness journey across different regions.

## Features

Add Workout Markers: Users can add markers to their current location to log workout details.
